Important notes:

There is 3 matlab files for each of coding functions(No channels, Channel incremental, coding 1/2)

*the part of creating the video in the last part of the code is commented 

* There is 2 cases for Probability of error, the first one is for showing the graphs (as a vector of multiple values(perr=0.00001:0.02:0.20001))
the second case is for creating the video (The probability of error represented by one value only(perr=[0.1])
